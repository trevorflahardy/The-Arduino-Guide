# Documentation Style

The official guide is written with **reStructuredText** and built using Sphinx. Use the following conventions:

- Top level headings: `===` underlines
- Second level headings: `---` underlines
- Third level headings: `~~~` underlines

Keep sentences short and prefer lists when introducing multiple steps. To build the documentation locally, see [Building the Documentation](building_docs.md).
