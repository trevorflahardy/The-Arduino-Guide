An Important Author Note
=========================

This book is designed to comprehensively cover the coding knowledge needed for the Foundations of Engineering Lab course at the University of South Florida; **It is assumed that you have no prior experience with programming**, and every concept will be explained from the ground up. From basic programming principles to more advanced topics, this book will guide you step-by-step through everything you need to know to develop effective Arduino programs for this course.

It is **highly recommended** to watch the USF Lecture named `Guide to Arduino Programming <https://usflearn.instructure.com/media_objects_iframe/m-4Yk6sdQUSQQSFNpTDzSkCCPySe5JcLJg?type=video?type=video>`_ by professor Schinnel Small before reading this book. The video will give you an overview of many of the topics covered in this book, and will show you hands on examples of how to get started with Arduino programming.

This book is **aimed at being a reference for the programming course material**. It details sections not completely covered in the video, clarifies topics, and provides additional examples, explanations, and exercises to help you understand Arduino programming. Additionally, it can be used as an easy reference for the coding aspect of this course, so you do not have to go back and refer to the video or lecture slides.

Programming can be challenging, but it's also one of the most rewarding skills you can develop. As the semester progresses, you might feel overwhelmed or tempted to rely on shortcuts, like using generative AI to write your code. However, doing so compromises the learning process and violates the school's academic integrity policy. More importantly, it denies you the opportunity to gain the skills that will set you apart as a future engineer—problem-solving, coding, and creating innovative solutions.

We understand that learning to program can feel daunting at times, and we're here to help you succeed. If you're struggling, **don't hesitate to ask for support**. Utilize the resources available to you—whether that's office hours, peer study groups, or tutoring services. Remember, making mistakes and asking questions are essential parts of the learning process. Embrace the challenge, and know that every step you take builds a foundation for an exciting future.

Without further ado, let's dive into the world of Arduino programming!
