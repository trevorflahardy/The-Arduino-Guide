    > `&&` returns true only if both sides are true.

### Which keyword begins a decision-making statement?
1. [x] if
    > `if` checks a condition before running code.
1. [ ] loop
1. [ ] goto

### What will this code print when `x` is 3?
```cpp
int x = 3;
if (x > 2) {
  Serial.println("yes");
} else {
  Serial.println("no");
}
```
> Evaluate the comparison `x > 2`.
1. [x] yes
    > 3 is greater than 2, so the `if` branch runs.
