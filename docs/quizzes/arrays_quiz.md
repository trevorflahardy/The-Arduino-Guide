1. [x] values[1];
    > Square brackets with index 1 retrieve the second element.
1. [ ] values<1>;

### Which line declares an array of five integers named `readings`?
> Specify the type, then the name with a size in brackets.
1. [ ] readings int[5];
1. [x] int readings[5];
    > Correct syntax uses `int readings[5];`.
1. [ ] int[5] readings;
1. [ ] array<int,5> readings;

### What index is used for the first element of an array?
> Arrays in Arduino start counting from this number.
