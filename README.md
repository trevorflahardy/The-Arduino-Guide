Welcome to The Arduino Guide, a repository dedicated to teaching students about the Arduino Programming Language. This repository is dedicated to the students of the University of South Florida taking the Foundations of Engineering Lab (EGN 3000L) course. It completely details the basis of Arduino programming and the use of the Arduino IDE. The guide is divided into several sections, each of which covers a specific aspect of Arduino programming. The guide is written in Markdown and is intended to be read on GitHub.
