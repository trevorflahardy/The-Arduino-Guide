# The Arduino Programming Guide

This repository is dedicated to the Arduino Programming Guide for the students of the University of South Florida taking the Foundations of Engineering Lab (`EGN 3000L`). It completely details the basis of Arduino programming and the use of the Arduino IDE. The guide is divided into several sections, each of which covers a specific aspect of Arduino programming. The guide is written in Markdown and is intended to be read on GitHub.
