Removing & Cleaning Your Prints
================================

Getting Your Print Off the Bed
------------------------------

Improper removal can easily damage both your print and our 3D printers. Follow these steps to remove your part safely:

1. **Wait for the bed to cool fully.**  
   Right after a print finishes, the build plate can be over 60 °C. Trying to remove a hot part can deform the bottom layers or burn your fingers. Let the plate reach room temperature before you start.

2. **Slide a scraper in gently.**  
   Use the flat edge of the approved lab scraper (not a screwdriver!) and wiggle it back and forth underneath the part. Never pry from one corner only-this can damage your print and gouge the plate.

3. **If it’s stuck, flex with care.**  
   Our printers use removable magnetic sheets. Remove the build plate using the tab on the front, bend it just enough to pop the print loose, then immediately put it back.

.. warning::
   Always keep hold of the plate and do **not** leave it on any surface. Warped or lost plates will result in revocation of your printing privileges, a replacement fee, and possibly farther consequences.

Removing Supports
-----------------

Supports help complex shapes print cleanly—but they must come off gently:

1. **Snip large supports first.**  
   In the lab toolbox, you’ll find flush-cutters. Use them to remove the biggest “trees” of support.

2. **Twist off finer supports by hand.**  
   Grip small struts between thumb and forefinger and twist along the layer lines until they release.

3. **Trim leftover nubs.**  
   If you have an x-acto knife, carefully make several shallow cuts—always pointing the blade away from you.

.. tip::
   PLA can seem less durable than it actually is. Be cautious and gentle when removing supports, but if you find yourself struggling it’s likely that you’re not applying enough force.

Sanding Basics
--------------

Sanding makes your print smooth—but dust and mistakes can hurt both you and the printer:

1. **Work through the grits:**
   - **120–150** grit to remove big blobs  
   - **220–320** grit to smooth layer lines  
   - **400–600** grit to polish the surface

2. **Wet-sand at fine grits.**  
   Add a drop of water for 400+ grit sanding—it traps dust and keeps the plastic cool.

3. **Sand in one direction.**  
   Consistent strokes hide scratches better than random motions.

.. note::
   Always wear a dust mask and safety goggles in the machine room. Never sand directly over a printer or shared workbench.

Final Cleanup & Lab Courtesy
----------------------------

- **Brush away dust.**  
  Use the lab’s soft-bristle brush or canned air—never blow with your mouth.

- **Wipe with isopropyl alcohol.**  
  A lint-free wipe and 70 % IPA remove grease, readying the part for grading or display.

- **Inspect under good light.**  
  Hold your print up so a TA or lab monitor can check for missed supports or cracks before you pack up.

.. tip::
   To signal you’re done, place your cleaned part and any tools back in their boxes, and leave the station tidy for the next person.

Your print is now ready for whatever comes next—presentation, assembly, or simply admiring a job well done!
