Removing & Cleaning Your Prints
================================

Getting Your Print Off the Bed
------------------------------

Improper removal can easily damage both your print and our 3D printers. Follow these steps to remove your part safely:

1. **Wait for the bed to cool fully.**  
   Right after a print finishes, the build plate can be over 60 °C. Trying to remove a hot part can deform the bottom layers or burn your fingers. Let the plate reach room temperature before you start.

2. **Slide a scraper in gently.**  
   Use the flat edge of the approved lab scraper (not a screwdriver!) and wiggle it back and forth underneath the part. Never pry from one corner only—this can damage your print and gouge the plate.

3. **If it’s stuck, flex with care.**  
   Our printers use removable magnetic plates. Remove the build plate using the tab on the front, bend it just enough to pop the print loose, then immediately put it back.

.. warning::
   Always keep hold of the plate and do **not** leave it on any surface. Warped or lost plates will result in revocation of your printing privileges, a replacement fee, and possibly further consequences.

Removing Supports
-----------------

Supports help complex shapes print cleanly—but they must come off gently:

1. **Snip large supports first.**  
   In the lab toolbox, you’ll find flush-cutters. Use them to remove the biggest “trees” of support.

2. **Twist off finer supports by hand.**  
   Grip small struts between thumb and forefinger and twist along the layer lines until they release.

3. **Trim leftover nubs.**  
   If you have an x-acto knife, carefully make several shallow cuts—always pointing the blade away from you.

.. tip::
   For stubborn supports, try gently rocking them back and forth along the layer lines instead of pulling straight out. This reduces the risk of damaging your print and helps the supports break away cleanly.

Final Cleanup & Lab Courtesy
----------------------------

- **Clean up excess PLA.**  
  There's a dedicated PLA disposal bin close to the printers. Any leftover filament from nozzle cleaning, rafts, or supports on the plate should be removed and properly disposed of.

- **Optional sanding.**
  If desired, use fine-grit sandpaper (220–400) to smooth rough spots. Sand gently and over a trash bin to catch dust. We do not provide sandpaper.

- **Inspect under good light.**  
  Hold your print up to a bright light source to check for layer-shifts, incomplete details, and any other imperfections.

- **Return tools and final check.**  
  Return any tools to their designated places. Before leaving the lab ensure the printer you used has a clean, properly installed build plate.
