Removing & Cleaning Your Prints
================================

Getting Your Print Off the Bed
------------------------------

Our lab’s printers are shared by the entire class—damaging a build plate or leaving it hot can delay everyone’s work. Follow these steps to remove your part safely:

1. **Wait for the bed to cool fully.**  
   Right after a print finishes, the build plate can be over 60 °C. Trying to remove a hot part can deform the bottom layers or burn your fingers. Let the plate reach room temperature before you start.

2. **Slide a scraper in gently.**  
   Use the flat edge of the approved lab scraper (not a screwdriver!) and wiggle it back and forth underneath the part. Never pry from one corner only—this can gouge the plate.

3. **If it’s stuck, flex with care.**  
   Our printers use removable spring-steel sheets. Unclip the sheet, bend it just enough to pop the print loose, then immediately reclip. Always keep hold of the sheet—don’t set it down on a table where it might warp.

.. warning::
   Do **not** leave a flex-sheet in your backpack or on any surface. Always return it to the printer before walking away.

Removing Supports
-----------------

Supports help complex shapes print cleanly—but they must come off gently:

1. **Snip large supports first.**  
   In the lab, we provide flush-cutters. Use them to remove the biggest “trees” of support.

2. **Twist off finer supports by hand.**  
   Grip small struts between thumb and forefinger and twist along the layer lines until they release.

3. **Trim leftover nubs.**  
   With a hobby knife, make several shallow cuts—always pointing the blade away from you.

.. tip::
   If a support area seems fragile, briefly dunk the part in warm water (no hotter than 40 °C). This softens the junction without harming PLA.

Sanding Basics
--------------

Sanding makes your print smooth—but dust and mistakes can hurt both you and the printer:

1. **Work through the grits:**
   - **120–150** grit to remove big blobs  
   - **220–320** grit to smooth layer lines  
   - **400–600** grit to polish the surface

2. **Wet-sand at fine grits.**  
   Add a drop of water for 400+ grit sanding—it traps dust and keeps the plastic cool.

3. **Sand in one direction.**  
   Consistent strokes hide scratches better than random motions.

.. note::
   Always wear a dust mask and safety goggles in the machine room. Never sand directly over a printer or shared workbench.

Final Cleanup & Lab Courtesy
----------------------------

- **Brush away dust.**  
  Use the lab’s soft-bristle brush or canned air—never blow with your mouth.

- **Wipe with isopropyl alcohol.**  
  A lint-free wipe and 70 % IPA remove grease, readying the part for grading or display.

- **Inspect under good light.**  
  Hold your print up so a TA or lab monitor can check for missed supports or cracks before you pack up.

.. tip::
   To signal you’re done, place your cleaned part and any tools back in their boxes, and leave the station tidy for the next person.

Your print is now ready for whatever comes next—presentation, assembly, or simply admiring a job well done!
